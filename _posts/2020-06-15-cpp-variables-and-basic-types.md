### Disclaimer
These are my notes from "C++ Primer Fifth Edition (Stanley B. Lippman, Jos√©e Lajoie, Barbara E. Moo)" while learning C++. I am just a student who repeats their words to understand C++ better.

### Initialization is not assignment
Initialization happens when we give a value while we are creating it. 
Assignment deletes an object's current value and replaces that value with the new one.

### List Initialization
4 different ways to define an int variable:

```cpp
int count = 0;
int count = {0};
int count{0};
int count(0);
```

The compiler will help us when we use list initialization:
```cpp
long double pi = 3.1415926536;

int x{pi}; // narrowing conversion required [1]
int y = {pi}; // narrowing conversion required [1]

int z(pi); // ok: but value will be truncated
int t = pi; // ok: but value will be truncated
```
