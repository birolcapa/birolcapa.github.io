RuuviTag is a generic sensor node, which suitable for many applications. Both of hardware and software are 100% open source. Their website has enough details about the product: <https://ruuvi.com/>

As a developer, I would like to program this tag, but their default development environment is not Windows. Developing Ruuvi Firmware part says of <https://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvitag_fw>

```Instructions below are tested using OS X and Ubuntu, but basically any Unix distribution (or even Windows) should be fine.```

So I started to search how can I create the development environment for programming RuuviTag with Windows 10. Here are the instructions:

1. Read here: <https://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvitag_fw>  
It will give you the community's default approach.
2. Download and install Segger Embedded Studio for Windows from <https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/embedded-studio/>  
When I downloaded, the file name was:  
```Setup_EmbeddedStudio_ARM_v352_win_x64.exe```
3. Download and install GNU ARM Embedded Toolchain 4.9 from <https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q3-update>  
When I downloaded, the file name was:  
```gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-win32.exe```  
I think it is a good idea to select checkbox so it will add regarding path to the environment variable: In my machine path variable was like that:  
`C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.9 2015q3\bin`
So if you run this in command promt:  
`arm-none-eabi-gcc â€“-version`  
In my machine the answer:  
`arm-none-eabi-gcc (GNU Tools for ARM Embedded Processors) 4.9.3 20150529 (release) [ARM/embedded-4_9-branch revision 227977]`
4. Install Git. I installed from <https://git-scm.com/>  
5. Then clone the repo: <https://github.com/ruuvi/ruuvitag_fw.git>  
6. Open git cmd for windows: git-cmd.exe. In my machine it was here:  
```C:\Program Files\Git```  
7. Go to the arm toolchain by using:  
```cd C:\Program Files (x86)\GNU Tools ARM Embedded\4.9 2015q3\bin```
8. Run gccvar.bat file to get regarding environment variables for compiling with arm toolchain.

9. Go to the cloned repo. In my machine it was here: D:\99_Temp\ruuvitag_fw![9](/images/gotocloneddir.png)
10. Call make ![10](/images/callmake.png)
11. In the end you will have .hex files.![11](/images/make_next.png)
12. To create DFU package, you need nrfutil python package. Open command prompt:
```console
cd C:\Python27
C:\Python27>curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
C:\Python27>get-pip.py
C:\Python27>cd Scripts
C:\Python27\Scripts>pip install nrfutil
```
13. When you run following command you should get response from nrfutil:  
```C:\Python27\Scripts>nrfutil version```  
In my machine it was like:  
```nrfutil version 4.0.0```
14. To create DFU package run following command under `C:\Python27\Scripts`:  
```console
nrfutil pkg generate --debug-mode --application _build/ruuvi_firmware.hex --hw-version 3 --sd-req 0x91 --key-file ~/git/ruuvitag_fw/keys/ruuvi_open_private.pem ruuvi_firmware_dfu.zip
```
In my pc, this command was like:  
```console
nrfutil pkg generate --debug-mode --application D:\99_Temp\ruuvitag_fw\ruuvi_examples\ruuvi_firmware\ruuvitag_b\s132\armgcc\_build\ruuvi_firmware.hex --hw-version 3 --sd-req 0x91 --key-file D:\99_Temp\ruuvitag_fw\keys\ruuvi_open_private.pem D:\99_Temp\ruuvitag_fw\ruuvi_examples\ruuvi_firmware\ruuvitag_b\s132\armgcc\_build\ruuvi_firmware_dfu.zip
```

With this effort, I was able to get the sources, compile them and run on RuuviTag just using only Windows 10.
