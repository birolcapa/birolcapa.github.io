I always wanted to use a Linux distribution in my daily life. Unfortunately, I was not able to be successful so far.

On the other hand, I discovered recently that Pluralsight has a really nice Linux path. Especially Andrew Mallet’s “Linux Command Line Interface (CLI) Fundamentals” was really great. With that course, I had a chance to learn command line usage (See <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/lpic-1">https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/lpic-1</a> for more details).

While watching the training, I noted many things.

Since I am not still using a Linux distribution in my daily life, I decided to create a simple “Linux Command Line Usage Cheat Sheet” for myself.

With that cheat sheet, I believe, I will not need google for daily use commands.

Here is regarding logs:
