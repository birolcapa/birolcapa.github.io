The very first question after building the PC is "now what?"  
My experience was like that:  
1. I turned on the PC and checked the BIOS.  
At least BIOS was telling me the hardware information: CPU, RAMs, Storage units  
Thankfully it was not surprising.  
2. I was going to use Windows 10, so my bootable USB was ready.  
3. After Windows setup, I connected my PC to internet, and got all the necessary Windows updates.  
4. During Windows update, I did not touch the PC, I needed to restart it several times, and that was it.  
5. After than, I checked drivers. Therefore I visited support pages of motherboard, CPU, GPU ...  
Windows had found the latest drivers already so I did not have to do much.  
6. Then I installed the anti virus.  
7. I was suspicious about if something is wrong still, so I checked several things afterwards briefly using following programs:  
7.1. cpuz <https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html>  
7.2. HWiNFO <https://www.hwinfo.com/>  
7.3. HWMonitor <https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/hwmonitor.html>   
8. Lastly I visited <https://www.userbenchmark.com> and tested speed of my PC with the help of UserBenchMark software.
9. So far so good. 
10. Unfortunately Windows does not have a package manager, so after a fresh install, I need to find my favourite programs one by one and install them again. But meanwhile, I found out via reddit that some people may have a solution for this:   <https://ninite.com>  
I used it and I think it is a great solution for my kind of problem.
