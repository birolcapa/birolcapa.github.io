I decided to build a PC.  
Since I have no clue about it, I got quite some help from my friends.  
During this process, some web pages were also quite useful for me.  
1. The very first website is: <https://pcpartpicker.com>  

2. As the community describes itself: "A place where all enthusiasts of PC, PC gaming and PC technology": <https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace>

3. A great YouTube channel: <https://www.youtube.com/c/LinusTechTips>  
They have so many videos even a "First Person View PC BUILD Guide!": <https://youtu.be/v7MYOpFONCU>

4. An excellent product rating website while buying a monitor: <https://www.rtings.com>

5. I used following reseller and had a nice experience with their web shop: <https://www.megekko.nl>

6. Virtual benchmarks and comparisons give great tips about the possible build configurations: <https://www.userbenchmark.com/PCBuilder>

7. While deciding the "PC Case", be careful about the  
    - Maximum CPU cooler height
    - Maximum graphics card length
    - Maximum PSU length
